## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Alexander Griboedov. I am a physist and worked for Philips (Healthcare Department) for 10+ years having grown form a Customer Cara Center Coordinator to a Finance Business Partner.

In August 2024, I completed the "Data Scientist" Training at Yandex, which significantly improved my hard skills at Python, SQL, and Machine Learing. I am currently seeking new carrier opportunities at Data Science / Data Analysis / Business Analysis.
