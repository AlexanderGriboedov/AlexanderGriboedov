## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Alexander Griboedov. I am a physicist and worked for Philips (Healthcare Department) for 10+ years having grown from a Customer Care Center Coordinator to a Finance Business Partner.

In August 2024, I completed the "Data Scientist" Training at Yandex, which significantly improved my hard skills at Python, SQL, and Machine Learning. I am currently seeking new career opportunities at Data Science / Data Analysis / Business Analysis.
